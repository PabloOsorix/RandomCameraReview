## Requirements of the client

The company "RandomCameraReviews" needs a system that allows professional photographers to upload "reviews" of Cameras, so that anyone from anywhere in the world can search for the reviews and buy them through their portal. The company has a team of developers specialized in FrontEnd that will create a portal for editors to upload the "reviews" and users can see them, and they have requested that you, as a Backend specialist, provide them with a system, including API that allows them to perform the next:

* Post reviews of Cameras
* Obtain the content of the reviews to display it in portal views in its web and mobile versions.
* User management for editors (does not include visitors reading reviews)

It is also known that the company "RandomCameraReviews" plans to distribute mostly in South America where its biggest market is, but they also have sales in North America, Europe, and very few in Asia.
